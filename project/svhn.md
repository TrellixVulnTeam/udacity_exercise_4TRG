1. i use this mode to get 92% vaild acc . but i think this model can generalize well
2. sorry my bad hack in cs. i haven't learned pytorch. so  i have got the nan loss. and no sense result.
3. base on the third method with the image i got the nearly 97% vaild acc because the manny task in preprocess
